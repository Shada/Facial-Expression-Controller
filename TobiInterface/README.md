# TobiInterface

This is the interface that will recognize facial expressions
and send input to the game.

The project is based on the CLM-framework (https://github.com/TadasBaltrusaitis/CLM-framework).

To send the input to a game, you'll need to install the vJoystick software.


## Demo Video
This video shows the TobiInterface in acction, reading the facial expressions of the player and interpretating them as a joystick controller.
