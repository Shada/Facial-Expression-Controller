# Joystick button/axis : distance/ratio name(s) [separated by ,] : threshold value(s) (strength of movement)  [separated by ,] ;
# "d_*" for distances "r_*" for ratios 

# pre-defined names exists for common distances (mouth corners, eye_corners, nose, etc.)
# distances between other landmarks is defined by "d_id1_id2" where id1 and id2 are landmark id's.

# common ratios also have defined names (eye width to eye height, mouth width to mouth height, etc.).
# to define custom ratios use the following style: "r_id1_id2_id3_id3", where the ratio will be:
# r = (distance(id1, id2) / distance(id3, id4))

# to get the center or mean of ceveral landmark positions, use the following syntax:
# "c_id1_id2_...idx". where id1, id2, ..., idx are the landmarks you want the center of.

# by using extension "*_x" or "*_y" it is possible to get the horizontal or vertical distance/ratio/center only.
